As my time at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) comes to an end, I have been reflecting on what makes some engineers truly stand out. The ones who consistently perform at the highest level, who are sought after for advice, and who land the most interesting projects all seem to share one thing in common: they genuinely love Computer Science.

These are the people who tinker with new technologies in their spare time, who stay curious long after their day’s work is done. They didn’t choose this field just for the high salaries or rocketing RSUs, they chose it because they’re fascinated by it.

This idea may not be surprising, but it is worth saying clearly. People who love what they do understand it more deeply. They ask better questions, notice subtle details, and develop better intuition over time. Over the past two years, I have often found myself asking about other people's projects, not because it was expected of me, but simply because I was interested. I wanted to understand the problems they were solving and how they approached them. I'm a strong believer that my curiosity has been the number one factor in my performance these last few years.

In my experience, the most important trait of high performers is passion. It matters far more than where someone went to school, what degrees they hold, or what background they come from. Software engineering can be a very rewarding career financially, but the people who succeed most consistently are those who truly enjoy the work itself.
